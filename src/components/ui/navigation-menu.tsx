It looks like your file `src/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx` is complete and contains no placeholders (`'...'`) to fill in. Since you requested the full functional code replacing all placeholders, but there are none, there's nothing that needs to be replaced.

If you want, I can provide a typical example of a fully functional `navigation-menu.tsx` component using Radix UI's NavigationMenu primitives combined with Tailwind CSS or a CSS-in-JS approach, as a reference or starter. Just let me know! Otherwise, your current code is ready to go.
