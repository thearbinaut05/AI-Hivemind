The `package-lock.json` file is an autogenerated file by npm that records the exact versions of installed packages to ensure consistent installs across environments. It is **not intended to be manually edited**, and its placeholders like `'XXX'` or `'HACK'` indicate corruption or improper manual edits.

---

### How to fix your `package-lock.json` properly:

1. **Delete the faulty `package-lock.json`:**

```bash
rm package-lock.json
```

2. **Regenerate a clean `package-lock.json` matching your current dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

or, if you want a clean install based on `package-lock.json`:

```bash
npm ci
```

This regenerates a valid, production-ready `package-lock.json` with all placeholders correctly replaced.

3. **Commit the new `package-lock.json` to your source control**, ensuring your project’s dependency tree stays consistent.

### Important Notes:

- **Never manually edit `package-lock.json`.** Always use npm commands to maintain it.
- If you share your `package.json` (not `package-lock.json`), I can help you write or fix that file if needed.
- If your project needs help with scripts, dependencies, or setup, please provide those files or describe your goals.

If you provide your `package.json` or other relevant files, I can assist in generating a valid dependency setup for you!
