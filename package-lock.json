`package-lock.json` is a generated file and should never be manually edited or contain placeholders. To fix placeholders like `'XXX'` or `'HACK'` inside it, you must delete the file and regenerate it by running `npm install`.

**Steps to fix your `package-lock.json`:**

1. Delete your existing `package-lock.json`:
   ```bash
   rm package-lock.json
   ```
   (or simply delete it using your file explorer)

2. Run npm install to generate a fresh, valid lock file reflecting your current dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This will produce a new `package-lock.json` locked to the exact versions actually installed, free of any placeholders or manual edits.

If you have any other source code files or configuration files that contain placeholders and you want me to help replace them with proper implementations, please share those files. I’m happy to provide clean, production-ready code!
