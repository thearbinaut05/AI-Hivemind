The `package-lock.json` file you referenced is an auto-generated dependency lock file for npm, and it does **not** contain any placeholders like `'XXX'` or `'HACK'`. This file is not intended to be manually edited or to contain any executable code or missing parts.

If your project has placeholders in other files (for example, JavaScript or TypeScript source files, configuration files, or scripts), please provide those files or code snippets, and I can help you replace the placeholders with functional code.

If you want assistance generating or repairing related files (such as a `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, React components, or TypeScript code) based on your project needs, just share more details or the relevant source files.

---

**In summary:**  
No changes or replacements are needed inside your `package-lock.json` file. It is already complete and functional as is.

Feel free to share any other files you want help with!
