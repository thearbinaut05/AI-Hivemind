`package-lock.json` is an automatically generated file by npm and should never contain manual placeholders like `'XXX'` or `'HACK'`. It is not meant to be manually edited.

**To fix the issue:**

1. Delete the faulty `package-lock.json` file that contains placeholders:

```bash
rm package-lock.json
```

2. Run the following command to regenerate a clean and valid `package-lock.json` based on your current `package.json` dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will produce a production-ready `package-lock.json` with all correct dependency versions and metadata filled in.

---

**Summary:**

- **Never** manually edit `package-lock.json`.
- Regenerate it via `npm install` or `npm ci`.
- Commit the regenerated `package-lock.json` to your repository.

If you need help fixing or creating your `package.json` file or any other source code, please share those files. I'm happy to help you create production-ready declarations or scripts.
